This meta repository contains all the custom ROS packages needed for the FRE.

## ROS Packages
 - [Virtual Maize Field](virtual_maize_field/README.md)
 - [jackal_fre](jackal_fre/README.md)

## FRE Setup - Installation
1.	Get a computer with ubuntu 18.04*. If you do not have a ubuntu 18.04 machine, you can install a virtual machine following the bullet points below. If you already have an ubuntu 18.04 machine you can skip to step 2.
	* Download and install VM ware from the VMware website: https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=PLAYER-1600&productId=1039&rPId=51984. Download "VMware Workstation 16.0.0 Player for Windows" if you are using a windows computer. Within VMware we install a virtual Linux computer. 
	* Create a new virtual machine using VMware
		* Change the configuration about the number of CPU cores used, the max number of RAM to use and the max allowable hard disk space. 
	* Select ubuntu 18.04 as iso. https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.5/ubuntu-18.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso 
2.	Open a terminal(Ctrl + Alt + T) and type `sudo apt install git` to install git
3.	Create a catkin workspace and move into it `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src && cd ~/catkin_ws/src`.
4.	While in this folder, clone the FRE git repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/FieldRobotEvent/Virtual_Field_Robot_Event` in the terminal. This will create a folder  named ‘Virtual_Field_Robot_Event’, containing all the files need to run the simulation.
5.	Install all required software by typing `sudo bash -i ~/catkin_ws/src/Virtual_Field_Robot_Event/install_requirements.sh`.
6.	After the installation type `source ~/.bashrc && cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make && source ~/.bashrc` in the terminal.
7.	You can now run the simulation by running `roslaunch virtual_maize_field simulation.launch world_name:=simple_row_level_1.world`. 
8. 	You can control the robot, and see the sensor output using `roslaunch jackal_viz view_robot.launch`. If you encounter any errors, we refer you to the troubleshooting section. 
9.	The robot used in the simulation is the Clearpath Jackal, you can find detailed instructions and documentation at http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/jackal/simulation.html. Be aware that the Jackal comes with a GPS but that the use of a GNSS receiver is not allowed except for the Free Style in Task 5. The focus for the other tasks in terms of localisation shall be on relative positioning and sensor based behaviours.

*) Feel free to use other versions of Ubuntu, ROS, packages and other software. We have only tested the above versions and software.


### Trouble shooting
* If you encounter the error: 'VMware: vmw_ioctl_command error Invalid argument.’ When launching gazebo. Then you should type `echo "export SVGA_VGPU10=0" >> ~/.profile` in the terminal and reboot your (virtual) machine. 
* If you encounter the error ‘Error in REST request’ when launching gazebo. Then you should open `~/.ignition/fuel/config.yaml` and change the line: ‘url: https://api.ignitionfuel.org’ to ‘url:  https://api.ignitionrobotics.org’.
* If the lidar data on the topic `front/scan` only returns ranges with the value `inf`, even though in simulation the lidar should ‘see’ certain objects within its range, you have to run `export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` in the terminal in which you launch gazebo. You have to run this command before starting gazebo. This solves the problem with the lidar, but might have some consequences on the rendering speed of gazebo.
