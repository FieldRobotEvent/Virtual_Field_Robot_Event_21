======

This package contains a copy of the [clearpath Jackal package](https://github.com/jackal/jackal). Minor modifications are applied to reflect to robot available on the event. 

Also a copy of the [lms1xx package](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/LMS1xx/tree/melodic-devel) is included. This package is modified to use the GPU lidar gazebo plugin, instead of the CPU gazbeo plugin.

we changed the camera settings for the flea3 camera according to our "real" robot. 
actual settings:
10 degree tilt
resolution: 640x 480 pix
the camera is included by default in the lidar config
